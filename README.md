pico]OS
=======

This is a fork of pico]OS realtime operating system.

It was originally created by Dennis Kuschel and Swen Moczarski,
see [original site at sourceforge](http://picoos.sf.net) for details.

Compared to official release it contains updated versions of
ports I have been writing (msp430, cortex-m, unix and lpc2xxx).
There is some information about these in [my blogs](http://stonepile.fi/tags/picoos).
