pico]OS
=======

This is a fork of pico]OS realtime operating system.

It was originally created by Dennis Kuschel and Swen Moczarski,
see [original site at sourceforge][1] for details.

Compared to official release it contains updated versions of
ports I have been writing (msp430, cortex-m, unix and lpc2xxx).
There is some information about these in [my blogs][2].

Updated doxygen manual is available [here][3].
