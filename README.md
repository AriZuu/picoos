pico]OS
=======

This is a fork of pico]OS realtime operating system.

It was originally created by Dennis Kuschel and Swen Moczarski,
see [original site at sourceforge][1] for details.

Compared to official release it contains updated versions of
ports I have been writing:

- Arm cortex-m0/m3/m4
- Texas Instruments MSP430
- Microchip PIC32
- NPX LPC2xxx (Arm7tdmi)
- Generic Unix (using ucontext(3))

There is some information about these in [my blogs][2].

Updated doxygen manual is available [here][3].
