pico]OS port form Microchip PIC32 CPUs
--------------------------------------

This is a port of pico]OS to Microchip PIC32 (mips architecture) chips.
Tested currently only with MPLAB X Simulator, as I don't have
any hardware yet.

Following features are supported:

- Tick sources:
  - MIPS core timer
  - TIMER1
- UART2 as console
